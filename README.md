## User Story 

* AS a user, I want a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and devoured.

## Technology

- MySQL
- Nodejs
- Express
- Handlebars
- ORM

## Description: 

* Create a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app should follow the MVC design pattern with the use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

* The app should allow user to:
    - Submits a burger's name
    - Display the burger on the left side of the page while waiting to be devoured
    - Each burger in the waiting area should have a Devour it! button
    - When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
    - The app should store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
